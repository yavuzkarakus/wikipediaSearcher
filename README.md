# wikipediaSearcher
This project draws inspiration from a design featured on the AsmrProg YouTube channel. It has been crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project goes a step further by implementing data fetching through the Fetch API to pull content from Wikipedia. I plan to further strengthen this design and incorporate more of my own creative elements.
