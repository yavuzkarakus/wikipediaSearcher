# Project Name: Wikipedia Searcher

👋 Welcome!

## Project Purpose

🌐 This project includes an exercise in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, based on the original design created by AsmrProg YouTube channel. The project utilizes the JavaScript Fetch API to retrieve content from Wikipedia. It has been prepared with the primary goal of enhancing my front-end web development skills, and I plan to further enrich the project by incorporating my own designs in the future.
